# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Brain-stroke-Data
This repository contains the project files for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on a dataset related to brain stroke occurrences. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights into the factors associated with brain strokes.

# Project Overview:
The EDA process is organized into the following key steps:

Importing Libraries and Data:

Loading essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others required for data analysis.
Importing the brain stroke dataset for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:

Stroke Density by Age: Analyzing the distribution of stroke cases across different age groups.
Gender Distribution: Understanding the gender distribution within the dataset and its correlation with stroke occurrences.
Hypertension: Exploring the prevalence of hypertension among patients and its relationship with stroke.
Presence of Heart Disease: Examining the impact of pre-existing heart conditions on stroke risk.
Marital Status: Analyzing the marital status of patients and its possible correlation with stroke.
Work Type of Patient: Investigating the distribution of stroke cases across different work types (e.g., government, private, self-employed).
Residence Type (Rural/Urban): Comparing stroke incidence based on whether patients live in rural or urban areas.
Average Glucose Level of Patient: Analyzing average glucose levels and their potential impact on stroke risk.
Body Mass Index (BMI) of Patient: Exploring the relationship between BMI and stroke incidence.
Smoking Status: Investigating the smoking habits of patients and their correlation with stroke.
Relationship Analysis:

Relationship of Gender & Age: Understanding how gender and age together influence stroke risk.

Relationship of Age & Location: Analyzing how age and the type of residence (rural/urban) relate to stroke cases.

Relationship between Age and Average Glucose Level: Exploring the correlation between age and glucose levels in the context of stroke risk.
Relationship between Average Glucose Level and BMI: Examining how glucose levels and BMI are related.
Relationship between Average Glucose Level and Stroke: Investigating how glucose levels may predict stroke occurrences.
Relationship Between BMI and Stroke: Analyzing the correlation between BMI and stroke incidence.
DABL Plot:

Utilizing the DABL (Data Analysis Baseline Library) to automatically generate plots that summarize key aspects of the data, aiding in the discovery of potential patterns and relationships.

# Technologies Used:
Python: For data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and DABL.

Jupyter Notebook: For organizing the analysis process and visualizing the results.
